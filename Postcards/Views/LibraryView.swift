/// column's *shared* toolbar section, an emergent artifact of how SwiftUI merges each column's
/// own toolbar contributions, and the alternative (an overlay bled into the titlebar band) was
/// unclickable on macOS because AppKit's titlebar owns hit-testing there. A pushed
/// `NavigationStack` destination's toolbar section is stable *by construction*: back/add/

/// panes have a meaningful ideal height (`MasonryGrid` is `GeometryReader`-rooted and `Map`
/// accepts anything), so a pushed browser collapsed to just its bottom search bar's height
/// (~44pt), pinned at the bottom of the column, with the rest showing empty sidebar material —
/// in both grid and map modes. The stack's root level is unaffected only because `List` is
